      <h1>Hi!</h1>
      <h1>Welcome to Whacko’s Rulesets!</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      I just thought this would be easier than trying to read it in chat.</p>
      <p>Hopefully this clarifies the basics!
    </p>

    <div class="rules">
      <h2>DA HARDCORE RULEZ:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><h3>Battle style</h3></li>
        <p>We’ll be rocking<mark>“Set”</mark> mode!<mark>“Shift”</mark> mode allows the player to get the advantage on every single opposing Pokemon.</p>
        <li><h3>Encounters!</h3></li>
        <p>Per standard nuzlocke rules, we will be using only the <mark>first Pokemon</mark> we encounter <mark>per route</mark>. Typically, this includes gift encounters.</p>
        <p>The route that a Pokemon counts for is defined by the <mark>location</mark> met within their <mark>Summary</mark>. There are exceptions to the rule that are game-specific, though this rule is typically hard-set.</p>
        <li><h3>Level Caps!</h3></li>
        <p>The ensuing gym leader’s highest leveled Pokemon is our level cap.</p>
        <p>Leveling up during the battle with the gym-leader is permitted</p>
        <p>If a Pokemon surpasses the current set level cap, it is still available for use outside of the gym battle, and not available for use against the gym leader.</p>
        <li><h3>Fainted Pokemon</h3></li>
        <p>If a Pokemon <mark>Faints,</mark> it must be placed in the <mark>death box.</mark></p>
        <p> I think it’s fun at the end of the run to look back at all the fallen friends that put their heart into a successful run. Plus, releasing them hurts my feelings way too much.</p>
        <li><h3>Duplication Clause!</h3></li>
        <p>We may <mark>not catch</mark> two Pokemon of the <mark>same species</mark> within the <mark>same run!</mark></p>
        <p>We may, however, continue to reroll the encounter until we find an encounter we have yet to find!</p>
        <li><h3>Shiny Clause!</h3></li>
        <p>We all love shinies, so if we find a random shiny it we can use it if we catch it, but it has to be <mark>random.</mark>We can't shiny hunt.</p>
        <li><h3>Items in Battle</h3></li>
        <p><mark>Only HELD ITEMS</mark> are permitted! Just to make things a little spicier! If it can’t be held, it can’t be used!
